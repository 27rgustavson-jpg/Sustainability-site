        <h2>The Why Behind the Certification</h2>
        <p>
          Reducing plastic and food waste is one of the most effective ways communities can cut greenhouse gas emissions
          and protect the environment. Plastics are made from fossil fuels, and their production and disposal release
          significant carbon emissions while creating long-lasting pollution that harms ecosystems and wildlife.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food waste poses an even more immediate climate threat: when food decomposes in landfills without oxygen,
          it produces methane, a greenhouse gas far more powerful than carbon dioxide. By reducing single-use plastics
          and diverting food waste from landfills, emissions are lowered, pollution is reduced, and organic material can be
          transformed into compost that supports healthier soils and carbon storage.

        <h2>Quick Start</h2>
        <p class="kicker">If you’re a business owner, start here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Understand which foodware is allowed (fiber, aluminum) and which is restricted (conventional plastics, many bioplastics like PLA, PFAS-containing items).</li>
          <li>Make sure accessories (utensils/straws) are only provided upon request and are compliant.</li>
          <li>Set up composting and follow SB 1383 rules for food waste diversion.</li>
        </ul>
